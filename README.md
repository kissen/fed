# fed

Trying to build a server for
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) that can handle all
objects defined in the standard. Development happens in the
`experiment/` branches. I work on this project when I have free time
and am motivated.  This happened in a while, but maybe the code is
useful for people interested in ActivityPub and in particular the
[go-fed/activity](https://github.com/go-fed/activity) library.

## What I Would Like

Current services like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) or
[Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) do a bit too much for my liking and
are difficult to install.  I would like `fed` to be easy to deploy and
self-host. The core service should be with only a minimal user interface,
leaving it up to the user how to interact with it.

I'm not sure if I will ever create something working. I do know that I
want this kind of software; hosting a private ActivityPub instance for
your own needs to way easier than it is right now.

## Credit

Even this small prototype wouldn't work with the help of many open
source projects. Some are directly included in this repository.
